Notes:
Ideas:
- Raspberry Pi hooked up, can remote into it, IP shows up as '192.168.0.106'
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2
TODO:
[âˆš] get datasheet for this
[!] figure out qemu
- tinker with this later, want to get the app working first, then I'll know exactly what to stub out or implement for QEMU
[x] hook up bread board to the correct GPIO pins and test out some GPIO libraries in go
Activity Log:
- got Raspberry Pi 3 hooked up
- setup dev environment for go in WSL
- go is installed on Pi
- added build script to build for target and upload to target
